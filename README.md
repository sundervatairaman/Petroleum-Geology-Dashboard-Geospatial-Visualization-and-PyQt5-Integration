# Geospatial Visualization and PyQt5 Integration

This project integrates **Dash** for web-based visualizations with **PyQt5** for desktop applications, focusing on geospatial data visualization using Plotly and shapefiles. It combines interactive data rendering with a user-friendly interface for enhanced usability.

## Features

- Load and display various geospatial datasets in shapefile format.
- Interactive visualizations using Dash and Plotly.
- PyQt5 integration for desktop GUIs with web-based visualization components.
- Support for shapefiles like tectonic plates, cratons, oil and gas fields, and geological features.
- Handles geopandas-based geospatial data processing.
