The two (northern and southern) Illustrator source files were massive, with layer counts totaling over 1,500 each. Files were analyzed to determine if direct import from Adobe Illustrator to ArcGIS (via software like MaPublisher) would be the most efficient method of file conversion. When examined at scales far more detailed than that of the printed map, many areas were found to have problems in topological relationships. Common topological problems in these areas included polygons that overlapped or had gaps between them, overlying line layers (contacts, faults, etc.) which were not coincident with polygon boundaries, and line features that self-overlapped. Although these problems were irrelevant to preparation of the hard copy map, they were unsuitable for feature class generation. 
     To minimize topological errors (estimated in the hundreds of thousands), features were created via a combination of direct export from Illustrator and raster auto-vectorization. Layers containing linework coincident with geologic unit boundaries were batch exported from Illustrator with the exception of the geologic contacts layer. The geologic contact layer was exported as a series of high-resolution monochrome tiles. Raster tiles exported from Adobe Illustrator were georeferenced to local geographic coordinate positions using control points in the DNAG projection (Snyder, 1987).  Images were auto-vectorized using ArcScan. Gaps and overlaps between tiles were rectified via raster painting tools. To create a topologically clean layer, topology rules were set in ArcMap and line dangles in the newly vectorized layer were snapped to the nearest unit-bordering line features. 
     Geologic unit layers were batch exported from the source Illustrator files and used as overlays for attributing the newly created polygon feature class. Through spatial querying, polygons in the unattributed layer that had their center within a specific overlay layer were attributed based on the overlay's geologic unit abbreviation. Remaining attribution for all other fields was completed quickly through VBA field calculator scripting based on the populated unit abbreviation field. Feature class symbolization was created to closely resemble the printed version of the GMNA. Finally, feature class symbology was exported to layer and style files.</procdesc><srcused>Reed, J.C.

Phanerozoic rocks regionally metamorphosed to amphibolite facies or higher (or blueschist facies or higher in active orogenic belts) are distinguished by a diagonal line overprint layer, as are rocks metamorphosed to granulite facies in the Canadian shield. Other special lithologies and depositional environments such as melange, predominately continental deposits, and off-shelf (not offshore) marine deposits exposed on land are also indicated by overprint layers.

The unit labels used on the map are intended to provide the maximum amount of information for each map unit. This greatly simplifies the map explanation and minimizes the need to repeatedly refer to it. However, the system requires long and complex letter symbols. In order to interpret the symbols, it is necessary to be aware of the following: 

1. Ages are indicated by uppercase letters and by lowercase letters and/or numbers preceding them. The lowercase letters and numbers indicate subdivisions of time-stratigraphic units. Most of these follow standard conventions, but because geologic special characters were substituted for standard characters, some are not obvious. Major subdivisions of time-stratigraphic units are generally indicated by l-lower, m-middle, and u-upper. In plutonic rocks the same subdivisions indicate Early, Middle, and Late. Further subdivisions are indicated by numbers, starting with the oldest = 1. In the Precambrian, superscripts are used for subdivisions, for example Y¹, Y², Y³. Combined units or units of uncertain age are indicated by double age designations, with the oldest age first. Where only an age designation appears in the unit label, the unit is sedimentary. In a few areas in the Canadian Shield and in the upper Midwest, the symbols Xcs and Xqz are used to identify units of Early Proterozoic sandstone and conglomerate, and quartzite, respectively. 

2. For volcanic rocks, the age designation is followed by a lowercase "v" (e.g., plTv-Pliocene volcanic rocks). Lowercase letters following the "v" indicate lithology: f-felsic; i-intermediate; m-mafic; sv-mixed sedimentary and volcanic; b--bimodal; k-alkalic (e.g., plTvmk-Pliocene alkaline mafic volcanics). 

3. For plutonic rocks, lowercase letters following the age designation indicate lithology: q-quartz monzonite and granite; g-undivided granitoid; f-felsite; i-granodiorite and quartz diorite; m-diorite and gabbro; y-syenite and monzodiorite; my-alkaline gabbro and syenite; a-anorthosite; and u-ultramafic. 

4. For high-grade metamorphic rocks, age of the protolith is given. Lowercase letters following the age designation indicate lithology of the protolith: n-gneiss; sn-sedimentary gneiss; gn-granitic gneiss; and sgn- paragneiss and orthogneiss. Undivided crystalline rocks are indicated by x. 

5. Lower-case letters without age designations indicate lithology of units of unknown or unspecified age: u- ultramafic rocks; x-crystalline rocks; g-granitoid rocks.

6. Seafloor units are indicated by single asterisks (*) following the unit abbreviation. Special seafloor units are indicated by two asterisks (**) following the unit abbreviation.  Description of special seafloor units can be found in the "MAP_UNIT_NOTE" attribution field of the feature class.

7. Units with a query (?) before the unit abbreviation indicate uncertainty about age. Units with a query (?) after the unit abbreviation indicate uncertainty about composition, or whether the rock is in situ. Unit uncertainty information can also be queried via the "UNIT_UNCERTAINTY" and "AGE_UNCERTAINTY" attribution field(s) of the feature class.
