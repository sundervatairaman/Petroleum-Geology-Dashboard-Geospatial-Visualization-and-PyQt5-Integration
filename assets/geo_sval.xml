      <abstract>This coverage includes arcs, polygons, and polygon labels that describe the generalized geologic age of
surface outcrops of bedrock of Svalbard. It also includes shorelines.</abstract>
      <purpose>To delineate geologic contacts and thematically depict generalized
geologic age of outcrops in Open File Report 97-470I Map Showing
Geology, Geologic Provinces, and Oil and Gas Fields of Europe including Turkey, which
is being compiled as a reference for the U.S. Geological Survey's World
Energy Project assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil
and gas resources of the world.  This coverage is used to produce a map
and an Adobe Acrobat Portable Document file of the map.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>All the attributes other than standard Arc/Info attributes are of character type.

1. Attribute item "GLG" (generalized geology) is abstracted from fill colors, fill patterns and labels on
UNESCO source maps denoting geologic age of surficial outcrops. Rock units whose age is divided within a
geologic period on the map are attributed undivided. For instance, units labeled "q", "qh", "qh`m", "qh`g",
"qh`fg", "qh`f", "qh`e", "qh`t", "qh`r", "qp", "qp`m", "qp`g", "qp`fg", "qp`f" and "qp`e" are attributed as "Q".
A more comprehensive discussion is offered below. Areas colored as surface water bodies and ocean are
attributed as "H2O". Areas outside of the political entities comprising Region 4, Europe, and Turkey are
attributed as "oth". Where there are disagreements on the original map sheets between the label and the fill
color, or where printing errors occur, the preference is given to the label in attributing the unit. In some
cases, a judgement is made according to the inferred geologic trend. Definitions for the values are found below
in the entity and attribute information section.

2. Standard verification of attribute reliability is performed
with the Arc/Info labelerrors command to find polygons without assigned character value or with more than one
value.

3. Plots are created of the coverage, colored and labeled by item "GLG" at the same scale, projection and map extent
of each of the UNESCO source map sheets for the purposes of review and examination. Review was conducted by persons
uninvolved in the compilation.

The geologic age generalized by USGS and the original UNESCO age classes are as follows:

Q = {q,qh,qh`m,qh`g,qh`fg,qh`f,qh`e,qh`t,qh`r,qp,qp`m,qp`g,qp`fg,qp`f,qp`e}
Qv = {V-q,B-qh,B-qp}
T = {q+ng,m,ng,m4,m3,m3+2,pg,m2,m1}
Tv = {V-m,B-m} CzMzv = {Vq-t,tq-t,B*q-t,aV*q-t,V`t*q-t,L`t*q-t}
CzMzi = {G-ne,M-ne,O-ne,U-ne,a-ne}
TK = {m+c}
Mz = {ms}
MzPz = {ms+pl,t+p}
K = {c,c2,c1}
KJ = {c+j}
J = {j,j3,j2,j1}
JTr = {j+t}
Tr = {t,t3,t2,t1}
Pz = {pl,pl2,pl1,h+d}
Pzv = {V*p-pr,L*p-pr,B*p-pr,aV*p-pr}
Pzi = {Mpl,Opl,Upl,aMpl}
P = {p,p2,p1}
C = {h,h2,h2`h,h1,h1`h}
D = {d,d3,d2,d1}
S = {s}
SO = {s+o}
O = {o}
Cm = {cb}
Pzm = {s+eo,cm+eo,pl+eo,pl1+eo}(metamorphic fill patterns present in all)
pCm = {eo,pl+pr,pr,prA,prB,prC,prD,G-pr2,G-prA,G-prB,M-pr2,M-prA,G-pr1, G-prC,G-prD,M-prC,I-pr,O-pr,U-pr,aM-pr}

No "s+cb" polygons of sufficient size were found on source map sheets.

Metamorphic rocks (Mzm,Pzm) were defined by metamorphic fill patterns on source map sheets.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Polygon topology exists. Each polygon has one unique label point with unique id, there are no dangles.
Polygons are bounded at perimeter of extent, including areas attributed as water and where geologic
age is not shown. The coverage is topologically cleaned and built in Arc/Info 7.1.2.</logic>
    <complete>Ages that are divided on the original maps are attributed as undivided. For example: two adjacent polygons
of Lower and Middle Cretaceous age are digitized and attributed as one polygon of Cretaceous age.
Some unusual age classifications are attributed in a more generalized or standard manner. For instance:
Silurian through Eocambrian is attributed as Paleozoic. Acid, intermediate and basic igneous rocks are not
differentiated and are attributed as either intrusive or extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Unknown error and distortion were introduced to the compilation when photocopies of the source map were enlarged to 200%.
Coastlines and inland water bodies abstracted from ESRI Arcworld 1:3m were used to rectify the scanned images of the
traced geologic contacts. Although a relatively low Root Mean Square (RMS) error was achieved in registering the scanned
images, the registration was inconsistent across the two map sheets used to compile this coverage and some difficulties
were encountered when joining the coverages digitized from the Western and Eastern maps sheets of the UNESCO source.
When the coverage was digitized there remained discrepencies with the ESRI sourced coverage. (ESRI Arcworld is chosen
as a standard because it is widely accepted and available.) These discrepencies are in part the result of the
registration problem, and in part caused by compilation differences between UNESCO and ESRI. Using a roving window,
piecewise rubbersheeting was performed with the Arc/Info adjust command, polygon option. Identifiable features of
inland water bodies and shorelines common to both sources are used as targets to create the "to - from" links for
adjusting the coverage. Overlaying plots of this coverage, corresponding to the source maps in scale, projection and map
extent, on a light table shows a variable offset ranging from 0 to 2 mm (10 km).

The following describe the tolerances:

1. Original geologic maps are presumed to be of 500 meter maximum accuracy (0.1mm at 1/5,000,000 scale)
2. Scanned gray-scale images are of 200 dot/inch resolution (0.13 mm on paper map)
3. Scanned images were registered and rectified with an average RMS error of ~1000 meters. (0.1 mm on paper map)
4. Fuzzy tolerance was set at 250 meters (0.31 pixel) and weed tolerance was set at 250 meters (0.31 pixel)
5. 100 points were sampled on the master coverage for fit with ESRI Arcworld country boundaries and an RMS error was calculated of 1,437 meters, the maximum error was 5,045 meters.</horizpar>
