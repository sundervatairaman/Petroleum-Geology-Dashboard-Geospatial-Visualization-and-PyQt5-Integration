    <descript>
      <abstract>The data set outlines and describes the general geologic age and type of bedrock of the Former Soviet Union and selected adjacent areas.  It also includes shoreline and inland water bodies.</abstract>
      <purpose>Although a geologic map displays the geographic distribution of the different geologic units and rock types for numerous purposes, this data set is compiled primarily for the World Energy Project as part of a required strategic base for assessing the petroleum potential of this region.  For this purpose, the map basically provides an outline of the general geographic distribution of both known or hypothetical petroleum-potential formations and units, i.e., sedimentary rocks and basins, and areas containing igneous and metamorphic rocks which have little or no potential.  The map is also compiled, in part, to provide a basis for outlining the geographic and petroleum provinces.  This basic geologic data set, combined with others, such as tectonic and burial histories, distribution of known oil and gas fields, distribution and quality of reservoir rocks, organic geochemistry, etc., ultimately defines the basis for the assessment of undiscovered oil and gas in the Former Soviet Union.</purpose>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>1. Original geological maps are of 750 meter maximum accuracy (0.1 mm on paper map of 1:7,500,000 scale)
2. Scanned images are of 200 dot/inch resolution (0.1 mm on paper).  That is why fuzzy tolerance for CLEAN programm in ARC/INFO is set to 1500 m (two pixels).
3. Several steps are taken to vectorize scanned images.  The projection and coordinate system for the original map are not given. Therefore it is necessary to georeference the map to real world coordinates. This is done as follows:  3.1. The latitude/longitude graticule with cell size 4 * 6 degree is projected to Equidistant Conic projection and then used to create ARC/INFO point coverage.  That point coverage is used to create "to - from" links by ARC/INFO CONTROLPOINTS program.
3.2  A gray-scale scanned image of the original paper map is transformed to Equidistant Conic projection by ARC/INFO GRIDWARP program (polynomial of the second order) using the "to - from" links created by CONTROLPOINTS program.
3.3  The scanned image from the second step is vectorized by the method of extraction of linear features described by F.Persits, 1997, (USGS open-file report OF-97-713), and then corrected by hands-on digitization.
3.4  A series of piecewise "rubbersheet" transformations are applied to the final ARC/INFO coverage.  The ARC/INFO coverages that are used for transformation were ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3 million GIS cartographic layers.  Overall position error is estimated with a randomly selected set of locations on the ESRI coverages and comparing the same locations on the final geology coverage (geo1).  RMS error is 4.8 km (0.64 mm of the original paper map) with maximum error about 12 km (1.6 mm on original paper map).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Procedures_Used:
Scanning original paper maps on large format Anatech Eagle scanner.  There is one copy for each of two sheets - gray scale (after original map scanning).  Images are in TIFF format at 200 dot/inch resolution.  The images then transformed to Equidistant Conic Projection by ARC/INFO GRIDWARP program (polynomial of the second order).  The "from-to" links for transformation are created by ARC/INFO CONTROLPOINTS program where latitude/longitude grid (point coverage) with cell size 6X4 degrees is used as a reference.  Georeferenced gray scale images from the first step are vectorized by the method of extraction linear features described by F. Persits, 1997, (USGS open-file report OF-97-713), and then corrected by hands-on digitizing.  After the vectorizing is completed, a series of piecewise "rubbersheet" transformations are applied to the ARC/INFO coverages created The ARC/INFO coverages used as reference for transformation are ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3 million GIS cartographic layers (RIV3M, CTRY3M).  To perform rubber transformation the combination of ARC/INFO ARCEDIT (add links) and ADJUST programs are applied.  There are a number of such transformations for every limited area on original coverage.  The geology attribute data are assigned using standardized geologic symbols for the World Energy project.  Although all polygons from the source maps are included in the data, geology was simplified from its original version, and attributed only by overall age; no technical division was made of geologic ages into upper, lower, early, late, etc., nor were geologic units differentiated within any particular geologic age or region as they appear on the source maps.  This is particularily true for Precambrian units.  ESRI's ArcInfo GIS system is used for cleaning and attributing.  Topology is created.  Some attributes are combined and some polygons generalized.
Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
Attributes and contacts are verified via visual editing and review.  A minimum of two reviewers examine and compare digital versions versus orignal material.  A comparison between color plot and original paper map was carried out by visual comparison.  Color plots in 1:7,500,000 scale were superimposed on each of corresponding original map sheets.  All errors detected in attributes were corrected.
